   "ctext": "The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.",

However, for trolls, she is a woman first and what matters right now is that she divorced a ?rich man?.  On Wednesday, Malaika Arora shared a gorgeous picture of herself on Instagram and a follower decided to troll her for using her ?alumni?

Apart from being a successful woman who lives life on her own terms, Malaika has literally played all the roles traditionally prescribed for a woman - she married quite early, had a son and raised him and was always around with the ?khandan?. But then, she got divorced and alimony is the taunt being thrown at her. The details of the alimony are only known to Malaika, her husband Arbaaz Khan and perhaps the family. The couple has handled the divorce with the utmost dignity. But we can vouch for the fact that she did not  need an alimony to buy clothes (short or not, her choice), go on vacations and enjoy her life. If anything, she is as successful, if not more, than her ex-husband.What happened between Arbaaz and Malaika is their personal concern. But to claim that Malaika married and then divorced Arbaaz for money doesn?t hold water.

Dr Biswas had just returned after a four-day leave of absence.Earlier, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey had ended up redefining the very meaning of virginity in his attempts to justify the awkward phrasing of the question in the form. Following a public furore over the document on Wednesday, the minister told news channels that there was nothing wrong with using the word ?virgin? because it simply meant ?kanya? or ?kunwari? ? which means an unmarried girl.Pandey had joined the cabinet just three days ago.Sources said the chief minister?s office had also taken cognizance of the issue, and asked for a copy of the form. It had even asked why the question was introduced in the first place.In its response, the management of the autonomous super-specialty health facility had clarified on Wednesday that it was in adherence to the central civil services rules followed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.The previous version of the marital declaration form, which purportedly asked new recruits if they were virgins.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(HT Photo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe marital declaration form had been in existence since the inception of the institute in 1983.

   "ctext": "Hotels in Mumbai and other Indian cities are to train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking such as frequent requests for bed linen changes or a \"Do not disturb\" sign left on the door for days on end. The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. \"Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,\" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. \"(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.\"The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case",

A native of Kasganj in UP, Kumar was unmarried and worked as a security guard at a government school in Pitampura till a few months ago.?During his stint at that school, he entered into a relationship with a married woman who worked as a peon.

A compensation of ?10 lakh was earlier awarded to the victim.

   "ctext": "In an interesting ruling, the Delhi high court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45 per cent after it found negligence on the part of both the parties.Deepak Kumar, the victim, was hit by a motor vehicle driven by a government employee named Ajay Kumar in Palam.Deepak told the court that while he was on his way to work, he stopped his vehicle after crossing Palam flyover to feed a cow. While he was crossing the road, he was hit and suffered injuries. The trial court had awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to him after ruling negligence on Ajay's part.Ajay challenged the trial court order based on the detailed accident report that mentioned motorcycle was not being driven dangerously or at an excessive speed, and was being driven in its lane and within the permissible speed limit.He sought examination of the contributory negligence on behalf of the injured through advocate Trideep Pais and Pranav Jain. The court observed, \"It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.\"\"Such people apart from impairing their own lives also pose a threat to the safety and security of the ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his own safety,\" the court added.Quoting the detailed accident report, the court said if the vehicle was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the accident which was caused at a non-zebra crossing, could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of the vehicle.In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and negligence would have to be shared by the claimant. While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, \" One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.\"\"The time of the accident was about 9.40 am. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road,\" the court added.",

   "ctext": " A 60-year old Dalit woman was allegedly lynched in Agra after villagers thought she was out to cut the hair of sleeping women, the first reported fatality of what appears to be turning into a case of mass hysteria.Growing number of people, particularly in rural districts, of Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have reported mysterious instances of sleeping women being attacked and their hair chopped off short.  Family members said Maan Devi left the home around 4am on Wednesday but lost her way, reaching a predominantly upper caste neighbourhood where people spotted her. ?She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took as one responsible for chopping women hair in Mutnai village and killed her,? said the victim?s daughter-in-law Kalpana Jatav.Local police first denied the death was connected to the ?ghost barber? panic. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Fatehabad, Dr Tej Veer Singh said a case was registered including charges relating to atrocities against Dalits, and teams were keeping a vigil in the area where the woman was killed.  The police also appeared to deny that the woman was beaten to death. ?The post-mortem report of Maan Devi indicates she died of cardiac arrest and not due to beating,? Singh said. Devi?s son has named two suspects, both from the upper caste Baghel community, in his complaint where he also said that his mother?s body had been thrown back in their village. Till Thursday, neither was arrested.Agra and villages in districts nearby were the latest to report the hair-cutting mystery that seems to be spreading since first being recorded in parts of the National Capital Region last week. Officials said on Friday that more ?sightings? were reported from the region, and the state?s Inspector General issued an appeal for people to remain calm.Women in at least five states have reported waking up to the sound of scissors, spotting black cats, and seeing ghosts and shadows. Some claimed they found portions of their hair chopped off, and others reported falling unconscious with fear.Police have dismissed the allegations as rumours in several of these cases, and administration officials are now issuing alerts for local law enforcement to tackle fear mongering. FROM MONKEY MAN TO UFOsParts of India, particularly rural districts where superstitious beliefs are common, have often been at the centre of mass hysteria events. In the summer of 2001, people in Delhi said they had spotted a mysterious monkey-like creature that appeared in the night and attacked people. Large colonies of the capital were gripped by fear as more and more bizarre ?sightings? were recorded. Vigilante groups patrolled the streets with sticks for weeks, before officials and psychiatric experts said the panic was created by ?figments of people?s imagination? that was made worse by the media coverage at the time.A year later, people in Eastern Uttar Pradesh reported spotting a light-emitting flying object that would attack them at night and scratch their face. Many referred to it as the ?muhnochwa?, a Bhojpuri amalgam that loosely translates to ?face snatcher?. At the height of the panic, people went off streets after sundown. Scientists from IIT Kanpur were roped in to investigate the event, and the ruled out the existence of the creature. The closest explanation, they said, could have been sightings of ball lightening, a rare meteorological phenomenon. Years earlier, in 1995, a more innocuous mass delusion took place when people across the country reported seeing idols of the Hindu god Ganesha drinking milk. ",

The Pawan Hans helicopter was on a training sortie on the evening of November 4, 2015. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked AAIB?to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry report, which was made public on Wednesday, said that the main pilot was flying low and that the other did not realise it. After taking off, the Rontappmeyer (RYTYR) helicopter may have faced difficulties as the moon was waning, the report said. The report mentioned that the instructor, Captain E Samuel, wasn?t disoriented and was aware of the low height of the helicopter. He alerted Captain TK Guha a little late, but even after realising that Guha wasn?t able to manage the situation, Samuel did not take control of the helicopter.AAIB recommended that ONGC, which owns Bombay High along with the helicopter operators, identify helidecks from where night flying can take place. AAIB also said that Pawan Hans pilots need to rest sufficiently before flying. Guha was flying during the night after a gap of almost a year, read the report.

Talking to HT, Bharti, a teacher from Kurukshetra, said Harshit got a hoax call, and not a letter, informing him about his selection for the post of graphic designer. ?Harshit got a phone call. We did not believe it at first. I kept telling him it could be hoax,? said the mother. ?He shared the information with his school principal, who further released a press note, which led to media coverage.?Bharti said once the news was published and mediapersons started contacting them, they too thought the job offer is genuine.?We thought the principal has some confirmation,? she said.Where did letter come from?However, question remains over the offer letter that the school has provided to the media, claiming that Harshit had forwarded it to a teacher. The letter has several mistakes and does not contain any salary details. Bharti maintained that Harshit did not provide it to the school. Harshit had completed Class 12 from Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 33, this year. It was on Saturday that the UT administration released a press note about Harshit?s achievement. The release claimed that the internet giant would pay him Rs 12 lakh per month as salary after a year?s training. During training, it was claimed he will get a stipend of Rs 4 lakh per month.However, on Tuesday, Google denied having offered paid training and job to Harshit. Bharti said Harshit hasn?t eaten since Tuesday and is hospitalised. ?Doctors say he is traumatised. Those who were congratulating us are now taunting us,? she said.Claiming they did not want to blame the principal or any teacher, Bharti said: ?Harshit only told her about the call.??Family evading authorities?However, Beniwal maintained that Harshit forwarded a copy of the offer letter to a teacher through WhatsApp. The principal alleged Harshit?s family had been evading the authorities and there phone number were also switched off.

   "ctext": "Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service. As a result, the list has been trimmed to 26. Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?s website ? www.mcg.gov.in. As reported earlier, MCG officials had reviewed the Central government?s notification regarding evaluation of property tax for commercial spaces and that to led to the civic body announcing the clause of tax waiver in lieu of free parking space.The 26 establishments offering free parking are Suncity Business Tower, Paras Twin Towers, MGF The Palm Springs Plaza, Global Foyer, Vipul Tech Square, MPD Tower, Augusta Point, Paras Downtown Tower, Central Plaza and Centrum Plaza ? all located on the Golf Course Road. On MG Road, ABW Tower, Sewa Corporate Park, Garden City Point, DLF Corporate Park, Platina Mall and Vipul Agora Mall will offer free parking.

   "text": "Scientists, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty DNA that causes a fatal heart disease to run in families. The disease, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, causes the heart to stop suddenly and is the result of an error in a single gene. The breakthrough could lead to preventing 10,000 disorders that are passed down the generations.",
   "ctext": "Scientists have modified human embryos to remove genetic mutations that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure.It is the first time that human embryos have had their genomes edited outside China, where researchers have performed a handful of small studies to see whether the approach could prevent inherited diseases from being passed on from one generation to the next.While none of the research so far has created babies from modified embryos, a move that would be illegal in many countries, the work represents a milestone in scientists? efforts to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trials one step closer.The work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer.?This embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations,? said Paula Amato, a fertility specialist involved in the US-Korean study at Oregon Health and Science University.The scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM. The disease, which leads to a thickening of the heart?s muscular wall, affects one in 500 people and is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.Crispr, or to give it its full name, Crispr-Cas9, allows scientists to precisely target and edit pieces of the genome. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA, that allows a specific site of interest on the DNA double helix to be targeted. The RNA molecule is attached to Cas9, a bacterial enzyme that works as a pair of \"molecular scissors\" to cut the DNA at the exact point required. This allows scientists to cut, paste and delete single letters of genetic code.�Humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. For the study, the scientists recruited a man who carried a single mutant copy of a gene called MYBPC3 which causes HCM.When the scientists made embryos with the man?s sperm and healthy eggs from donors, they found that, as expected, about half of the embryos carried the mutant gene. If the affected embryos were implanted into women and carried to term, the resulting children would inherit the heart condition.Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how gene editing dramatically reduced the number of embryos that carried the dangerous mutation. When performed early enough, at the same time as fertilisation, 42 out of 58 embryos, or 72%, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation.The work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others. Another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest work the scientists found no evidence of these so-called ?off target effects??They?ve got remarkably good results, it?s a big advance.? said Richard Hynes, a geneticist at MIT who this year co-chaired a major report on human genome editing for the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS). ?This brings it closer to clinic, but there?s still a lot of work to do.?Today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for IVF and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. The procedure can only help if there is a chance that some embryos will be healthy. According to Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who led the latest research, gene editing could bolster the number of healthy embryos available for doctors to implant.More work is needed to prove that gene editing would be safe to do in people, but even if it seems safe, scientists face major regulatory hurdles before clinical trials could start. In the US, Congress has barred the Food and Drug Administration from even considering human trials with edited embryos, while in the UK it is illegal to implant genetically modified embryos in women. The procedure is controversial because genetic modifications made to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generations too. ?It?s still a long road ahead,? said Mitalipov. ?It?s unclear when we?d be allowed to move on.?In the latest study, the mutation was corrected by a route that scientists have not seen before, with the cell copying healthy DNA from the mother?s egg instead of the template. One question scientists need to explore now is whether mutations carried by eggs can be corrected as easily as those carried by sperm.?If all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward,? said Janet Rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.Asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, Rossant, a co-author of the NAS report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. ?We are still a long way from serious consideration of using gene editing to enhance traits in babies,? she said. ?We don?t understand the genetic basis of many of the human traits that might be targets for enhancement. Even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.??The NAS report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential,? she added.",

This should never happen,? ?Islam is and always will be a curse,? ?Get them out of our country ? frightening times we are living in,? and: ?I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,? according to thelocal.no and other media.The photograph, found on the internet, was posted ?for a joke? last week by Johan Sl�ttavik, who has since described himself as ?Norway?s worst web troll and proud of it?, beneath a question asking the group: ?What do people think of this??Sl�ttavik told Nettavisen and Norway?s TV2 he wanted to ?highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism?, and was ?interested to see how people?s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react. I ended up having a good laugh.?It went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group?s outraged comments.?What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?? he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times. The comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group?s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing ?Islamification? of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats. One warned the group was making itself look ridiculous.Beyer told Nettavisen: ?I?m shocked at how much hate and fake news is spread [on the Fedrelandet viktigst page]. So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.?The head of Norway?s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly ?see what they want to see ? and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims?.Norway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria all restrict full-face veils in some public places.The country?s minority government, a coalition of the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress party that faces elections next month, said in June it was confident it would find opposition support for the move.Per Sandberg, then acting immigration and integration minister, told a press conference that face-covering garments such as the niqab or burqa ?do not belong in Norwegian schools. The ability to communicate is a basic value.?",

   "ctext": "In a bizarre medical condition, a newborn baby in Thane was found to be ?pregnant? with his half-formed twin brother feeding off his blood supply. The condition, called fetus in fetu, is so rare that only about 100-200 such cases have been reported from all over the world till date. The boy was born to a 19-year old woman from Mumbra on July 20 at Bilal Hospital in Thane, near Mumbai.The 7cm foetus, weighing 150 gm and complete with a brain, arms and limbs, was found behind the baby?s stomach. A radiologist first spotted the abnormal mass during a routine scan of the pregnant mother.?In post-natal scans, we spotted another half-formed baby with a brain, arm and legs in a foetal sac in the baby?s abdomen,? radiologist Bhavna Thorat told German news agency DPA.After the baby was born, another scan found that the ?twin? was feeding off his nutrition and posed a life threat.Doctors referred him to the Titan hospital in Thane, where the parasitic foetus was successfully removed by a specialist team of experts. It is suspected to be a rare congenital anomaly called ?fetus in fetu? in which a malformed  foetus gets absorbed into the body of it?s twin. The team that performed the surgery at Titan Hospital, Thane.  Photo Credit: Neena NichlaniGynecologist Dr Neena Nichlani, who was part of the team that operated on the baby, said, ?It is a case of monozygotic twin pregnancy sharing single placenta, where one foetus is wrapped around the other and feeds off its host?s body.? As both the twins draw nutrients from a single umbilical chord, the chances of survival are usually low in such cases. ?It is a very rare condition and this is for the first time I have encountered such a case in my  entire medical career...  Both the baby and the mother are doing well,? she added. ",

",
   "ctext": "Dozens of street vendors will have to take their wares elsewhere as authorities in Delhi are gearing up to clear the perennial congestion near the neighbouring hospitals AIIMS and Safdarjung.The area will be turned into a \"no hawker zone\" as the encroachers cripple traffic movement and also get in the way of emergency vehicles.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has directed the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) chairman to take control of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg stretches from the Public Works Department (PWD).The move by the L-G follows repeated complaints from Safdarjung Hospital authorities that doctors and patients get delayed in reaching the institute on time as they get stuck in traffic outside.Dr AK Rai, director of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, \"I have been getting complaints from patients' relatives, doctors and other hospital staff on being late in reaching the hospital when it's the need of the hour. Every day, it is the same issue and one gets stuck in traffic for nearly 20 minutes.\"A meeting was held on Monday with the Safdarjung director and Naresh Kumar, the civic council chief.\"The NDMC chairman formed a committee including officials and experts from the council, Delhi traffic police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). These two road stretches - Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg -would be now declared as no-hawker zone strictly,\" Dr Rai informed.The emergency wards of both the hospitals are crowded with critically ill and trauma patients every day and ambulances coming from the Ring Road side always get stuck because it is highly congested during peak hours, said a doctor.\"For us, the main issue is to improve the traffic movement,\" Naresh Kumar told Mail Today. \"We are looking for temporary, medium and long-term solutions. Delhi traffic police will manage the traffic movement at the bus and auto-rickshaw stands.\" \"Moreover, most of the space on the road is occupied by private cabs. At the time of monsoon, there should be no traffic jam at Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg. All unauthorised hawkers will be removed from the entire zone,\" Kumar added.Heavy rains cause massive waterlogging at the entire stretch every year. Hordes of street vendors and hawkers are running their business illegally in the area and blocking the way, said Kumar.\"Our main focus is to improve the road infrastructure. From now onwards, Aurobindo Marg is under the jurisdiction of NDMC,\" he iterated.The Safdarjung Hospital director too pointed out that a rapid rise in the number of illegal vendors has created a bottleneck outside the hospital.\"It is advisable to shift the bus stop on Ring Road side and shops in the subway of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg. Proper pedestrian path should be made,\" said Dr Rai.Echoing similar views, Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS, underscored the importance of streamlining traffic movement in such a manner that patients and doctors coming to the hospital get a smooth passage and pedestrians and other commuters too do not face hassles.ALSO READ |",

However, they said that they will challenge the acquisition in the court for enhanced compensation, as their counterparts in Ghaziabad have received compensation up to Rs17,000 per square metre.The farmers held a meeting with the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, BN Singh, on Monday on the issue but could not arrive at a consensus.Teja Gurjar, a farmer leader said, ?The administration has agreed to release the arrested farmers, but has asked us not to obstruct work on Eastern Peripheral Expressway.?The district magistrate said, ?I have met the farmers and have agreed to release the arrested men on the condition that they provide an affidavit that they will not indulge in anti-social activities such as blocking rail routes or obstructing construction work at the expressway site.? The compensation will be awarded as per the government norms and court?s orders, said Singh.Farmers of 39 villages in Greater Noida and adjoining areas had joined hands in protest on Friday, demanding enhanced compensation and said they had decided not to give their agricultural land for the compensation amount proposed by the government.In 2016, the compensation rate was decided at Rs3,500 per square metre, which was enhanced to Rs3,640 per square metre in 2017.

   "text": "Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.",
   "ctext": "Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation. ",

The small aircraft, a Cessna, appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said.The plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing, according to Portuguese TV pictures. Local reports said the aircraft was registered to a flying school in Torres Vedras.The Portuguese newspaper Di�rio de Not�cias reported that the Aerocondor aviation school in Cascais had confirmed the aircraft ? a Cessna CS?AVA ? was ?on a training flight with one student and one senior instructor?, who had ?high experience and thousands of hours of flying time?.The dead girl was with her parents, who were unhurt, witnesses told local media. The plane passed over the dead man?s legs as he sunbathed on a towel, they said.One witness, Rita Rogado, 20, told the P�blico newspaper that the plane crashed right by the sea, dragging her along for a few metres in the sand. Some sunbathers said the plane appeared to be gliding, as they heard no engine noise.? This article was amended on 3 August 2017. An earlier version said S�o Jo�o da Caparica beach was 20 miles south of Lisbon. This has been corrected to 12 miles.",

We do not have the concept of preservation in India,? said Arvind Untawale, secretary, MSI. ?The idea behind selecting these 12 locations is to enhance conservation and protection of different mangrove species, the biodiversity and establish them as international tourism destinations.?He added that tigers in Sunderbans, saltwater crocodiles in Odisha, and birds, fish, crabs, and the unique flora present in this ecosystem are not getting enough attention from the Centre. ?There is great potential for adventure, research, information, conservation and management aspects, which the tourism sector needs to focus upon,? said Untawale.Mangroves in?Vikhroli. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(HT File)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?What most people are unaware of is that India is home to a maximum number of flora and fauna species in the world,? said Dr K Kathiresan, former dean and director, Annamalai University and from the Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology. He added that of the total 4,060 species living in India?s mangroves, 969 are floral species, accounting for 24% of the biodiversity and the rest 3,091 are faunal species. ?Mangrove forests can sequester carbon 10 times more than tropical forests and carbon storage is four times more than tropical, temperate or boreal forests (coniferous forests),? said Dr Kathiresan.Experts said the tourism potential of mangroves in India, unlike many other countries in the world, is underexplored. ?We have to develop such spots for people to realise its importance. Tourism spots will not only help boost revenue but even their protection,? said N Vasudevan, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Maharashtra state mangrove cell. SAVING THE NATURAL COAST GUARDS While India has 3% of the world?s mangrove cover, environmentalists believe they are under threat from developmental projects. Here are the 12 unique mangrove forest locations selected for better conservation:Gulf of Kutch, GujaratEstablished in 1980 and 1982, the Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park (163 sq km) and Marine Sanctuary (295 sq km) are mangrove forests spread across 42 islands with rich marine and mangrove biodiversity. They are accessible from Jamnagar by boats that travel 10km to reach these areas. Vikhroli mangroves, MumbaiIt is one of the largest (2000ha) private mangrove forests in the country. More than 16 mangrove species, 82 butterfly species, 208 bird species, 13 crab species, 7 prawn species, 20 fish species and mammals like jackals, wild boards, mongoose, otters and leopards can be spotted at the mangrove ecosystem.Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Centre, Airoli, Navi MumbaiThe centre, a pet project of the Maharashtra state mangrove cell, was completed and opened for public earlier this year. It is surrounded by a flamingo sanctuary that is spread over 1,690 ha, which includes 896 ha of mangroves and 794 ha of land adjacent to a water body, to safeguard more than 50,000 flamingos visiting every year.Achra, Maharashtra The mangroves near the fishing village of Achra are considered sacred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(HT?FILE)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLocated near the fishing village of Achra, almost 30km away from Kankavli on the Mumbai-Goa highway, this is the most dense mangrove spot in the Konkan region. Here, the mangroves are considered sacred as the entire area is owned by Rameshwar temple trust. Dr Salim Ali Mangrove Sanctuary, GoaEstablished in 1982, a 250-hectare mangrove patch at Chodan, located very close to Panjim, is home to 16 mangrove species, more than 100 birds and large intertidal fauna. The area has boat facilities, walkways and observation towers for a closer look at the salt-tolerant plants.Kali Nadi, Karnataka With the Western Ghats in the background, the lush green mangrove cover along the Devbagh creek of the Kali Nadi estuary near Karwar, Karnataka, is considered the most sacred mangrove forests of the state. Kannur, Kerala Situated along the famous Kerala backwaters and not very far from Kochi, large portions (587 ha) of the Kannur mangrove forest were recently declared as reserved forests (highest protection status) after a significant mangrove cover was lost owing to developmental projects. However, several parts were restored by the forest department with man-made mangrove patches that cater to both marine and intertidal biodiversity.Pichavaram and Muthupet, Tamil NaduTwo mangrove spots along the Tamil Nadu coastline ? Pichavaran near Chidambaram and Muthupet near Pulicat Lake ? are fed with Vellary estuary waters and are rich in mangrove biodiversity. The forests are famous for natural genetic cross breeding of the Rhizophora mangrove species. Coringa and Krishna Wildlife Sanctuaries, Andhra PradeshThe Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, situated on the mouth of the Godavari estuarine delta, has a mangrove expanse spread across 235.7 sq km. It was established in 1978 and is accessible by road and by boats from Vishakhapatnam. Established in 1999, the Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary in Guntur is spread across 195 sq km and located at the mouth of Krishna estuary.The Mahanadi estuarine in Odisha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(HT?FILE)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and Kendrapada Mangroves, OdishaThe Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, along the Mahanadi estuarine, is known to have the highest mangrove biodiversity in Asia and is famous for the estuarine crocodiles that are 22-feet-long. Spread across 145 sq km, the sanctuary was established in 1988. The Kendrapada mangroves have mangrove area of 133 sq km.Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, West BengalSpread across a massive 1,40,000 ha land along the Ganges delta, the Sunderbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world between Bangladesh and West Bengal. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The swampy mangroves are also home to chitals, crocodiles, monitor lizards and several birds.Andaman and Nicobar IslandsTourists around teh mangroves in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(HT?FILE)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEstablished between 1983 and 1986, two national parks ?

The prankster fooled Scaramucci by posing as recently-fired Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, as a Russian envoy and finally as one of his friends. The prankster said he targeted Scaramucci because he had used mental health issues as a \"put down\".",
   "ctext": "A suspected British prankster appears to have conned White House officials including Anthony Scaramucci into replying to him after pretending in email correspondence to be several different members of the Trump team.The man, who goes by the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, posed as Jared Kushner well enough to convince homeland security adviser Tom Bossert to reply to him, according to CNN. Bossert included his personal email address in the exchange.Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptly�threatened to fire everyone in his team�over leaks. He also staged a combative and�contradictory�briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about�suspiciously liberal pronouncements�in his past and support for Trump?s Republican enemies;�deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans to�Lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve Bannon�down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son;�saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ?�resigned�after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates had�warned�the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.The most shocking firing of them all.�Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this Russia thing?. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president�handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci?s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after�an infamous debut�in which he angrily insisted Trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy?s�lethal Saturday Night Live impression�a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to Trump through Friday,�when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood ?Gropegate? tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?Oct 8th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.The man also fooled Scaramucci, the White House communications director who was fired on Monday, by pretending to be Reince Priebus, the former Trump administration chief of staff with whom he was believed to be in open warfare.In a series of emails, the man posing as Priebus baited Scaramucci, accusing him of being ?breathtakingly hypocritical? and saying ?at no stage have you acted in a way that is remotely classy?.Scaramucci responded: ?You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.?The heated exchange continued, with the prankster writing: ?I can?t believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called ?Mooch?, who can?t even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake. I have nothing to apologize for.?Scaramucci replied: ?Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.? The White House has confirmed it is looking into the matter. ?We take all cyber related issues very seriously and are looking into these incidents further,? press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN.Reince (me) giving @Scaramucci something to think about. He never replied haha pic.twitter.com/hutjACmogRAn excerpt of what I emailed to @Scaramucci whilst playing the part of Jon Huntsman Jr. Apparently this didn't seem out of the ordinary?! ?? pic.twitter.com/6INHJi3KCDThe man, who described himself as a ?lazy anarchist? on his Twitter profile, told CNN that his actions were meant to be ?humorous? not malicious.?I?m not trying to get the keys to the vault or anything like that.?He has previously convinced Scaramucci that he was the ambassador to Russia-designate Jon Hunstman and tricked Hunstman himself into believing he was the president?s son Eric Trump. He also fleetingly convinced Eric Trump he was his brother, Donald Jr. ",

",
   "ctext": "A woman parliamentarian of Imran Khan?s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has stirred up a major row by accusing the cricketer-turned-politician of sending her ?obscene? text messages and harassing women leaders of the party.Ayesha Gulalai, elected to the National Assembly in 2013 from a reserved seat for women in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, also announced her decision to quit the PTI because she could not compromise on her honour and dignity.Addressing a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, Gulalai said the ?honour? of women in the PTI is not safe because of 64-year-old Khan, whom she called a ?fake Pathan?. Gulalai, who hails from the conservative South Waziristan tribal region and is the sister of leading squash player Maria Toorpakai, said Khan is a ?characterless person? who considers himself an angel but his conduct is ?highly indecent?. There was no response to the allegations from Khan though PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry dismissed Gulalai?s allegations and claimed she had ?sold her soul? for money.The lawmaker said she had received numerous text messages from Khan, and the first one was sent from his Blackberry in October 2013. She declined to read out the messages but asked journalists to contact the telecom authority in this context. She urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the matter for the sake of the honour of women members of the PTI as there is speculation that Khan might one day become the prime minister. Gulalai said her decision to quit the PTI had nothing to do with a case regarding Khan?s assets that is being heard by the Supreme Court. ?The criterion for awarding party tickets is entirely different in the PTI,? she said.She said she had the courage to come out against Khan and his clan as she is a brave Pathan and honour was more important to her. The lawmaker went on to say that Khan was more impressed by Western culture and wanted to replicate it in Pakistan.?Their change is confined to social media while workers like me work on the ground, whom they call inferior workers. When I used to attend meetings, Imran Khan gave tips on how to ridicule rivals and target them,? she said.Gulalai also accused the PTI government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of corruption and said chief minister Pervez Khattak was acting like a ?mafia boss?.She rejected reports that she was joining the PML-N party of former premier Nawaz Sharif but praised him for respecting women.

The 52-year-old British novelist, best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series, said yesterday that she deleted her July 28 tweets after she was informed that they were \"not a full or accurate representation\" of what had happened at last Mondays health care event at the White House. Rowling came under fire for a series of now-deleted tweets in which she slammed Trump for seeming to ignore Montgomery Weers outstretched hand. \"How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,\" the author had said. But Marjorie Kelly Weer, mother of Montgomery, said Rowlings interpretation of the clip was wrong. \"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage. Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,\" Rowling tweeted. \"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly,\" she wrote. Trump is said to have shaken the boys hand as the president entered the room, the BBC reported. \"If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didnt snub my son & Monty wasnt even trying to shake his hand,\" Kelly wrote on Facebook.

The data from the year 2016 is collected in the only station that has the technology, says Gufran Beig, project director of SAFAR.The safe standards of PM1 have not been defined yet, in the absence of which its potentially harmful effects have not been documented. Globally, too, there might not be a standard but PM1 is considered the most dangerous among all particulate matter, particularly because of its size. It measures around 1 micron or less in diameter and can enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream.According to a Central Pollution Control Board 2010 study, small particulate matter can reach the alveolar region, causing heart ailments. These fine particles cover a large surface area, absorb toxic compounds such as heavy metals and organic compounds with high carbon content, the study said.These particles ? spewed primarily from vehicles, factories and construction sites ? are not dispersed and stay suspended in the air.But why is the air in Central Delhi flooded with these particulates??PM1 is a major product of vehicular combustion. Roads in and around the Lodhi Road area like other parts of Lutyens? Delhi see a huge flow of vehicles. This might be the reason behind the prevalence of this finer particulate matter. It also depends on where the station is located, the dispersion capacity, meteorological factors, among others,? Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB told Hindustan Times.",

Nearly 500 protesters had pelted stones at the police during the protest demanding that the facility be opened to pilgrims immediately. The facility has remained sealed since its inauguration last year.",
   "ctext": "The Ghaziabad police arrested three persons and lodged an FIR under sections of the IPC and Criminal Law Amendment Act against them. Also, 14 persons were booked for causing damage to public property.The police have also named the involvement of 300-400 unidentified persons for inciting violence near ?Ala Hazrat Haj House? on Monday night.Those arrested include Naseem Khan, district president of Congress? minority cell and Puja Chaddha, the district president of Congress? women?s cell. Other Congress leaders have also been named in the FIR, in which the police alleged that 14 police personnel, including four sub-inspectors and a woman constable, were injured.?The FIR is lodged at Sahibabad police station and we have arrested three persons in this connection. Teams are on the lookout for other persons and trying to identify them through video footage,? Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city), said.A large number of locals and Congress workers started gathering outside the Haj House near river Hindon from Monday afternoon, despite prohibitory orders in place in the district. The police also charged them under Section 188 of the IPC, which is applied only when prohibitory orders are violated.?Naseem Khan and Puja Chaddha are not traceable. We will protest against the police and the administration and will also hand them a memorandum about the lathi charge carried out by police on innocent people who were staging a peaceful dharna outside the Haj House. There were some miscreants who resorted to violence but they were outsiders,? said Harendra Kasana, district president of the Congress.For the last one week, since the Haj pilgrimage is on, locals have been demanding that the newly constructed Haj House, which was inaugurated by former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in September 2016, be opened.However, the Haj House is caught up in litigation after three residents approached the National Green Tribunal and demanded its demolition, contending that the structure was built on land chunks of the Hindon floodplains.The tribunal on September 2, 2016, had said in its order, ?We make it clear that any steps or construction taken in the meanwhile shall be subject to the orders of the Tribunal passed in this Application (sic).?Earlier on July 27, Hindustan Times had published a report listing the reasons for closure of the facility. In response, UP minister Mohsin Raza had said that the decision not to make the Haj House operational was taken by the previous government (led by former Akhilesh Yadav) and the present government is continuing the same.?The decision was already taken by the previous government as the matter was with NGT even before the present government assumed office. The decision was taken to protect the environment and the river ecology. The influx of thousands of pilgrims is bound to create garbage issues in the river zone. This decision was taken earlier to avoid being in contempt of court,? Raza had said.In the meantime, the district administration has deployed police and provincial armed constabulary personnel outside the Haj House and are keeping a tight vigil on activities that may lead to an escalation of law and order.",

He said he had been invited by them to perform at a family function eight months ago. Sunil added that he is planning to take legal action against them.",
   "ctext": "After accusing director Anees Bazme and his friend and associate Mayur Barot for non-payment of dues, comedian Sunil Pal is now planning to take legal action against both of them. However, Anees completely denies the charges. ?About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). They told me I will be paid a certain amount later. But I never got my payment. And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant. I was shocked when he replied that I can do whatever I want to and that it won?t affect him,? says Sunil, adding both of them even said that they would cast him in their films but that too never happened. Meanwhile, the comedian-actor also contacted Cine And TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) and they had asked him to come with a written complaint. But Sunil never went to the cops because he thought that filing a case would take too much time. He therefore decided to make a video with a message for Bazmee and shared it on his Facebook page. In the video he says that he is sorry that Mubarakan didn?t work, and that its God?s way of showing justice to those who wrong others.?I made the video and sent it to Anees Bazmee around noon on Monday but he didn?t reply. So I thought I must upload it on Facebook. Some people have come to my support. Now I am planning to take legal action against both of them. I won?t let them get away like this,? adds Sunil of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge fame.Director Anees Bazmee denied the allegation brought against him by Sunil Pal.When we got in touch with Bazmee he said that the deal happened between Mayur and Sunil and he has nothing to do in it. ?I was just a mediator, who introduced them, beyond that I know nothing. Why will I do something like this for such a small amount? Sunil used to visit my Mumbai office and he was looking for work. Also I never promised to cast him in my film,? says the Welcome Back (2015) director. Voicing a similar opinion, Barot points out that the reason Sunil has dragged Bazmee?s name is because he is a well-known person. ?Sir (Anees Bazmi) has nothing to do with it. Sunil was looking for work and wanted to perform at this function. There was no discussion regarding remuneration. But then after sometime he said he wants his payment and even used foul language when I refused. His false accusation is defamatory for someone like me who is just starting his journey (he is producing Remo Dsouza?s film Nawabzade) in Bollywood. I just wanted to help Sunil, but it backfired,? adds Barot. Follow @htshowbiz for more",

In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.",

This came after shares fell as much as 18% during the day after it fired its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie with immediate effect for 'gross misconduct'. However, his son said he resigned over an 'extremely distressing mental health issue'. ",
   "ctext": "The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for ?gross misconduct?, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.?Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,? the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a ?personal conduct related matter?, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. ?He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,? it said. ?The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.?The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about �200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie?s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company?s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.?The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. ?At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,? the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie?s departure, adding that they ?do not believe that it is fraud-related?.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to �403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. ?After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,? the Liberum analysts said. ?We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.?Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.?The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director.",

   "ctext": "Naseeruddin Shah has watched the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring his wife Ratna Pathak Shah, twice. And the veteran actor can?t figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. ?I really don?t know what problem they had with the film. I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. Afterwards, the Lipstick team got the required clearance from a parallel body. This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipstick?s release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen. It?s very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn?t like. But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.?Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial. ?For starters,? he says, ?they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release. But then they claim to be someone who can do that. Their narrow-minded approach affects the film industry. But nothing has been done about it.?Follow @htshowbiz for more ",

Amitabh also shared a photograph of himself from a film?s set, where he was seen taking a nap. The 74-year-old actor is seen wearing a white kurta pyjama, socks and a monkey cap in the image.  The Piku actor said that with the lighting on the set, one actually goes of to sleep. ?One actually goes to sleep, while the lighting and the action and the scene is being conducted... Such a delight. And my sleep was genuine, they actually had to come and wake me up to tell me that it was over,? he added. The 74-year-old will be seen sharing screen space with veteran actor Rishi Kapoor in 102 Not Out. The two will be working together after over two decades. Amitabh will also be seen in Thugs of Hindostan, which also stars Aamir Khan, Katrina Kaif and Dangal fame Fatima Sana Sheikh. The film is directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya.

As part of efforts to revive the national carrier, the Cabinet has given in-principle approval for divestment and the final contours are being worked out by a group of ministers. \"If Air India today is in this financial situation it was not because of Air India but successive governments have short-changed Air India and treated it like their private properties and at times private airlines, be international or domestic came under category of favoured airlines,\" Trivedi told PTI.

BAT has denied allegations of a whistleblower who handed over multiple documents to SFO. However, BAT has said it is cooperating with UK authorities as campaigners are now urging US government to act.",
   "ctext": "Allegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, despite the cigarette company?s attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence.BAT, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with Reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of Paul Hopkins, whom it employed in Africa for 13 years. When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as ?a rogue former employee?.The company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.The SFO?s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. In a statement it said it was ?investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT, its subsidiaries and associated persons?. It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.The news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.BAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins? charges. ?We have been cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office and British American Tobacco has been informed that the SFO has now opened a formal investigation. BAT intends to cooperate with that investigation,? it said.The company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by Hopkins.He has claimed he paid bribes on the company?s behalf to the Kenya Revenue Authority for access to information that BAT could use against its Kenyan competitor Mastermind. Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.BAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a ?full investigation? into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case.Louis Charalambous, Hopkins? solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. ?We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,? he said in a statement.?Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.?Now their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.?Hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. ?I rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,? he said.Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: ?At the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.?Eighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it?s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO must leave no stone unturned.?Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. ?The allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,? he said.?As British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the company?s alleged misconduct.?The BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would ?act in a very strong way? if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. He said: ?We are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everything?s going to go by the book.?The SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.",

   "ctext": "It took him five years and lot of courage to openly speak about his battle with drug addiction. After making a promising start in Bollywood, Prateik Babbar vanished from the limelight for a good five years. His absence might not have caught anybody's attention, but his return has grabbed many eyeballs. And why not? For the first time, the 30-year-old actor has openly spoken about his battle with substance abuse. When many actors shy away from talking about their issues, Prateik has come out in the open, talking about his his long battle with addiction. In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, the actor talked about addiction, recovery and his career. This is what he said. On addiction He has come to terms with complications of his life and has fought the demons of substance abuse. It was last year when he first talked about his drug addiction, and in the last one year, he has been a \"work in progress\". \"Addiction is not a moral failing, it does not make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice. People still think I got hooked because it was 'cool' for a celebrity to indulge in recreational drugs. But for me, it was more of an escape from reality. My childhood was complicated and there were a lot of questions I didn't have answers to so I looked elsewhere for solace,\" said Prateik. �On acceptanceIt took him a while to understand that he was an addict, and he needed to get out of it as soon as possible. \"Acceptance and speaking up can help change the face of addiction. It educates those who are ailing and tells others that the stereotype of people suffering is the exception rather than the rule. Acceptance is one of the first steps to recovery,\" added the actor. On coming outPrateik came out in open about his addiction as he didn't want to keep his fans in the dark. He wanted them to be aware of the dark truth of his life. \"I'm a fighter and criticism is not an option for me. Yes, one is entitled to his/her opinion and it's human to be judgmental but everyone deserves a second chance. The idea is to move on. I want to create awareness by showcasing the boy uninterrupted so the world doesn't get to see just one side of the story,\" said the 30-year-old actor. On recoveryIt has taken him a few years to get back to his normal life and he says that with each passing day, he is making an effort to better his life. He said, \"I'm still on the road to recovery but I'm proud to have turned over a new leaf. Substance abuse is like a bad marriage, even after you quit, it haunts you for a while till people start noticing the turnaround. I'm answerable to only my conscience. And yes, people take me more seriously now that I'm no longer the hippie rave but someone committed to fitness, auditions and family.\"On his careerHe began his career with the 2008 film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, and went onto bag a few promising roles in the subsequent years. However, it's been almost five years since Prateik has been seen on the big screen. But the actor is all set to bounce back. \"I'm looking for quality work and am not embarrassed to go out and ask for it. I'm also doing a lot of theatre with Jeff Goldberg because I believe it polishes your acting skills,\" he added. ",

A male member added, \"But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.\" Kiran said that such thoughts were regressive.",
   "ctext": "The CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) seems to have forgotten that their job is to certify, not censor. The latest victim of their scissors is Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. The Pahlaj Nihalani-led board ordered a whopping 48 cuts to the film, and when India Today Television reached out to him, he said, \"We are just doing our job.\"But this is not the worst of it. Disparaging sexist comments were allegedly made by CBFC members about the producer, Kiran Shroff, for green-lighting a film with such 'abusive' content. According to a report in Bombay Times, a female member asked her how she, as a woman, could be involved in the making of a film with so many abuses. At this point, a male member is said to have interjected, \"Inhone to pant-shirt pehni hai. Yeh aurat thodi hi hain.\"Kiran told the publication, \"They had an internal discussion for an hour after the screening. First, they told us that they were giving us an A certificate. Then they told us that there are 48 cuts. We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much, and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it.\"She added, \"In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, 'Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.' I was dumbfounded. This is such a regressive thought... Sadly, this is the kind of humiliation producers have to put up with. If they are judging me by my clothes, I can imagine the parameters they must have used to pass my film.\"Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has been directed to do away with abusive words as well as 80 per cent of its \"humping\" scenes. Director Kushan Nandy was appalled and told the daily, \"First and foremost, we don't have humping scenes. They are love-making scenes. I am shocked and appalled with what has happened. If you notice the cuts, there's a sentence, 'Yeh kaahe ka c******a hai'. We use such sentences in our everyday life. The excuse given to us is that children also sneak into cinema halls to watch adult films. How is that my problem? Penalise the cinema halls for this, not the producers. The way they have dealt with our film is insulting. They humiliated Kiran which is unpardonable.\"Apparently, the filmmaker has been asked to get rid of a bunch of sentences with the word \"khada\" in it. He met Pahlaj Nihalani in private to discuss the directives, but the CBFC chief had a shocking response - \"You are lucky I'm not banning your film.\"Kushan said, \"When I argued that there are no grounds to do that, he retorted, 'What are these abuses? Do you plan to make a dictionary of bad words?' He even asked me to change lines like 'Maa ka lehenga' to 'Maa ka anchal'. In short, the essence of what is being said is lost. He told me, 'C*****a ko tutiya kar do.' He is basically trying to teach us to make a film. And finally, he told me to remove the line that has 'Khada' in it. He said, 'I will never let it pass because I am abused for my song Khada Hai Khada Hai to this day.' I'll fight this till the end.\"Pahlaj Nihalani refused to comment on the matter.At a media interaction today, Kiran Shroff shared all that the CBFC members told her. One CBFC board member asked Kiran Shroff(producer) 'Why as a woman have you made this film?: Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThen another CBFC board member said 'ye to pant shirt pehne huye hain woman thodi hain': Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThey(CBFC) told us that we have given 48 cuts in the film: Kiran Shroff,Producer #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/NbFBDWZHSpThen Pahlaj Nihalani came and told me that I am lucky that my film is not banned: Kushan Nandy,Director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/RHBxREjM4f",

   "ctext": "Actor Sana Khan was up for a not-so-pleasant surprise on Tuesday, when a video of her hugging actor Salman Khan went viral for all the wrong reasons. Sana walked the red carpet at a recently held TV awards show in Mumbai, and when she spotted Salman, the two exchanged a hug. What made it news was Salman?s closed fists, and his shy smile. ?I still can?t believe that a normal hug was trending, trolling, and rolling,? says Sana. ?People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug.? The actor adds that it?s only normal for people to wear backless clothes at a red carpet event.    There is always a wild side to an innocent face ?? Look for Big zee entertainment awards ?

Sana replies, ?Who am I to make him feel uncomfortable? It?s stupid to put somebody down by saying such a nasty thing and showing me in a wrong light. It?s not [as if] I went to hug him and he didn?t recognise me.?But why that closed fist? ?Couldn?t it be somebody?s style? Maybe he hugs like that. I don?t know. I think the best person [whom] to ask this would be Salman. [Also] He has been in the [film] industry for over 25 years, so don?t think backless even matters to him? he has seen more than that (laughs). Let?s not talk like a five-year-old and make all this sound so big,? says Sana.I?m not a psychopath to hug somebody if the person doesn?t want to talk to me. I?m not someone who makes people stand and keep talking and falling on their lap.Sana has known Salman ever since she first appeared in 2012 on the reality show Bigg Boss (which was hosted by Salman) and later worked with the actor in the 2014 film Jai Ho. Lashing out at those who are calling it a forced hug, Sana retorts, ?I?m not a psychopath to hug somebody if the person doesn?t want to talk to me. I?m not someone who makes people stand and keep talking and falling on their lap. I am on good terms with Salman; we share a rapport, I talk to him on and off, we?ve met so many times, I?ve been to his house, and we have worked together on the sets also. So there?s nothing to feel awkward [about].?The actor shares that she had a brief two-minute chat with Salman, and that may have got everyone curious. ?For a moment, Salman didn?t recognise me ? he literally told me that. [Then] he complimented me that I look very nice. And I said, ?Yes, I?ve dropped 7kg?, and he is like, ?It?s showing,?? reveals Sana.Was it the backless outfit that made the hug look ?awkward?? Sana says, ?Well, could be. Maybe he didn?t want my back bronzer to fall on his clothes. He has worked with all sexy and good-looking actresses, who would use bronzer from head to toe, so he knows that. And it?s not that he wants to feel me up or I want to feel him up. I am sorry, we have all grown up from that zone. We need to respect each other?s space and gestures.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",

   "text": "Dia Mirza, while talking about being trolled on social media, said she used to get frightened by the rape and acid attack threats she received online for expressing her opinion. Dia added, \"Elements...who are faceless and nameless...who harass people, (don't) need to be taken seriously...we need to be like ducks and let (trolling) be like water sliding off our backs.\"",
   "ctext": "Actor Dia Mirza, who was in Delhi to walk for designer Anju Modi at the India Couture Week 2017, has not just a lovely face but also a strong mind. And that is something Twitter trolls couldn?t digest. In this era of non-stop trolling, Dia recalls how, in her early days in Bollywood, she was targeted for expressing her opinion on various issues. In recent times, Dia?s tweets have advocated water conservation on Holi and a noise-free Diwali. ?In the earlier days, when I did get trolled, it really affected and frightened me. Because when you?re told that people want to throw acid on you, or they want to rape you, or kill you, or call you anti-national because of something that you?ve said... and they ask you to move to another country... and it?s all new to you, then it really alarms you,? she says. The 35-year-old actor was trolled  on social media  when she had tweeted and urged her fans to play a dry Holi. She had written: ?The irony of the times we live in: farmers commit suicide due to drought and people waste water to ?play? #Holi. Go ahead call me anti-Hindu.? The trolls were quick to tag her as anti-national. Dia was also called intolerant when she had tweeted about wanting a cracker-free Diwali. Now, after so many years in Bollywood, Dia takes such crude reactions in her stride. The actor states that she has always voiced her opinion on issues that deeply matter to her. ?I have continued to express my opinion. I reserve my opinion for things that truly matter to me. And when you express your opinion on something that deeply matters to you, it doesn?t matter how people construe it,? she says. ?I feel that those elements on social media who are faceless and nameless, who make it their business to harass people, [don?t] need to be taken seriously. I?ve been in the public sphere long enough now to understand that we need to be like ducks and let this [trolling] be like water sliding off our backs. The only thing that matters is our own truth. The intent is what should matter,? adds the actor. Dia will be seen next in the Sanjay Dutt biopic by Rajkumar Hirani; she plays the role of Maanyata, Dutt?s wife. Speaking about her film and working with Hirani ? he is the director of such blockbusters as Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006), 3 Idiots (2009), and PK (2014) ?  Dia says, ?Rajkumar Hirani is my favourite director. (Dia worked with Hirani in Lage Raho Munnabhai, starring Sanjay Dutt as Munnabhai.) It was an absolute pleasure to be asked by him to be a part of Sanjay Dutt?s biopic. [Hirani] is one of those real people who tells stories in the most unique and honest way. I have known Sanju sir for many years and through the course of my interaction with him, I have interacted with Maanyata as well. It has been such an honour and joy working with Rajkumar Hirani, Ranbir (Kapoor, who plays Dutt?s role in biopic), Anushka (Sharma), and Vicky Kaushal.?",

Doctors said Ansari suffered multiple injuries on his head, neck, legs and back.Over the past few months, several people have been lynched in the BJP-ruled state over charges ranging from raping women, smuggling cow,  and child-lifting. The latest incident took place at a Pragya Kendra, a government-run service centre that offer facilities such as linking Aadhaar number with other documents, issuing caste certificates, voter ID cards and PAN cards. When people turned up at the common service centre with their respective requisitions on Wednesday morning, they allegedly found Ansari half-naked with a woman at the Heena Market Pragya Kendra.He was dragged out of the office premises and beaten with sticks, belts, shoes and slippers by the mob.Ansari fell unconscious after the assault, but the mob continued thrashing him until the police intervened, sources said.The police rushed Ansari to the Bokaro General Hospital. He was yet to regain consciousness, doctors said.Bokaro deputy superintendent of police Poonam Minz said that the police have lodged an unnamed first information report against the mob, and arrested one Mantu Yadav in connection with the case.?We have arrested one, and are scanning the CCTV footage to identify others who assaulted the man,? she said.In April, a 25-year-old man was beaten to death in Saraikela Kharsawan for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl. On June 8, a 45-year-old man was lynched for allegedly raping a widow in Palamu and on June 27, another man was beaten to death by a mob for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl in Dumka.Police deployed additional security forces across the affected area to prevent the incident from snowballing into a communal conflagration.?Rumour-mongers on social media too are under our scanner,? said a Bokaro police official working with the cyber cell of the district.",

   "ctext": "In a ridiculous step, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna has asked its employees to declare whether they are virgin. The marriage declaration form which has come to light is applicable for hospital employees and freshly recruited doctors and nursing staffs. The form also asks male employees to provide details if they have more than one wife.Women employees apart from declaring status regarding their virginity have also been asked to provide details on whether she is married to a person who has no other wife living or another wife living. Speaking to India Today, the Deputy Medical Superintendent, Dr Manish Mandal said that the marriage declaration form with the contentious questions have been in practice ever since the institute was established in 1984.\"Everyone has to fill this form which is part of Central Services Rules and this form is similar to what AIIMS in Delhi uses. If the Centre or AIIMS changes the format of the form in the future, we will also change it. This is not a new form and has been in practice since 1984 when IGIMS was established\", said Mandal.� Elaborating on the need to extract personal details like one's virginity, Dr Mandal said that the questions have been asked in order to avert any kind of wrong doing. \"In the Central Services Rules there is a provision that when a person joins the service and later on if she dies because of any eventuality, there may be a claimant or boy friend who may come to seek job in place of the victim\", said Dr Mandal . However, Dr Mandal admitted that the use of word virginity was incorrect.\"Essentially what is being asked in the form is whether a person is married or unmarried?� Personally I feel the word used should have been unmarried instead of virgin. That would have been sober but what is there in the rules have to be followed,\" said Dr Mandal.",

The institution has frequently clashed with the government of the president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who has repeatedly called for a ?religious reformation? in Islam to combat extremism.Egypt has grappled with a spike in jihadist activity since Sisi came to power in 2013, including a recent string of large-scale attacks on Coptic Christian sites as well as ongoing violence in the Sinai peninsula.Al-Azhar, established in Cairo in 971 as a centre of Sunni Muslim learning, is hoping that the booth will help steer Egyptians away from extremist thought.Sheikh Tamer Mattar, the coordinator of its International Centre for Electronic Fatwas, said that the booth was designed to direct citizens to seek advice from al-Azhar, instead of extremist groups. ?The experiment was successful so far and we hope that it will expand,? he said. ?We can say it was successful, as in the eight days of the initiative, we received 1,500 questions. At any moment you can find tens of people waiting to present theirs.?The booth operates two shifts daily, welcoming visitors from 9am until 8pm. Yet few seemed convinced that the project would attract those with pre-existing extremist tendencies to seek guidance, especially as those staffing the booth noted down the identity card number of those visiting along with their complaints. Extremists won?t come to us to seek advice,? said the sheikh staffing the booth for its morning shift. ?We?re targeting people on the street who are ignorant of religious matters ? they come to us and we try to put them on the right track of moderation.? Mohamed Abu-Hamed, an Egyptian MP who has sparred frequently with al-Azhar over a desire for greater government regulation of the religious body and its teachings, dismissed the booths. ?The whole project is absurd. It is a superficial understanding of the call to renew the religious rhetoric,? he said.?When we talk about renewing religious rhetoric, we mean the main content [of their teachings],? he said. ?If al-Azhar created these kiosks while thinking that this is renewing religious rhetoric, then they don?t get it. They are doing this to evade making any real changes.? ",

For gifts above Rs 5000, they have to pay the additional amount, said an official of the toshakhana who is from the Central Board of Customs and Excise.The watch, entered as a Sekonda ?House of Commons? wristwatch, was valued at Rs 3,500. Besides the watch, the PM also took a decorative porcelain valued at Rs 1000. Among the gifts received by Modi between January and March are a model of the fabled Sha?bi housing model of the United Arab Emirates, a decorative sculpture with Argillite carving and a Mont Blanc ballpoint pen.These six gift items among the 83 latest entries at the toshakhana.The Mont Blanc pen is valued at Rs 2500 and is kept at the toshakhana. Also deposited at the repository is the model of Emirati National House, valued at Rs 4500 and a the decorative sculpture with Argillite carving, valued at Rs 2000. Argillite carvings are a sculptural tradition in the northwest coast of North America. It first became a widespread art form from the early 19th century. The toshakhana, however, doesn?t reveal the source of gifts on the ground that such disclosure is not in the interest of the bilateral relationships with countries.Officials said ministers and officials rarely take home very expensive gifts home. According to the records at the toshakhana, in the past Modi took two dinner sets worth Rs 10,000 and a carpet worth Rs 15000, after paying the excess amounts.A report said former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took 101 items from the numerous gifts he received during his 10 years in office.These gifts include an ornamental silver elephant embedded with semi-precious stones, 10 paintings, a Bose sound system and a gold-plated Piaget ladies wrist watch. And out of these, only seven are valued above Rs 5,000.",

The move triggered an angry response from the Congress, which accused the BJP of carrying out ?an unprecedented witch-hunt?. Party leaders raised the matter in parliament, protesting noisily and forcing multiple adjournments in the Rajya Sabha.

The approval comes in wake of a 2006 Supreme Court's verdict, which asked Centre and state governments to draft rules for making marriage registration compulsory. Reportedly, ?10 fine will be levied for delay up to a year and ?50 beyond that.",
   "ctext": "The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved a proposal to make registration of marriages compulsory for every resident of the state, regardless of religion or community.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presided over a cabinet meeting to adopt the Uttar Pradesh Marriage Registration Rules-2017, which stipulates compulsory registration of marital alliances and lays down penalties for any delay in this regard. Though the fines are not particularly hefty ? Rs 10 for delay up to a year and Rs 50 beyond that period ? it is liable to increase over time. ?We took all sections of society into confidence before taking a decision on the issue,? health minister Siddharth Nath Singh told mediapersons later in the day.However, Singh admitted that the cabinet did not concede to demands from a few Muslim clerics who wanted their community exempt from having to furnish photographs of the bride and groom. ?Yes, they made such a demand because the nikahnama (the Islamic marriage contract) does not carry images. But if photographs can be submitted to procure documents such as Aadhaar cards, I don?t see why the same cannot be done for marriage registration,? he said.While the stamps and registration department will double as the nodal agency for marriage registration, the government will launch an online portal to ensure easy access. The Centre had already made marriage registration compulsory across the country, in keeping with a 2006 Supreme Court ruling. Uttar Pradesh was among the only two states that had failed to implement the directive, an anomaly that minister for women welfare and tourism development Rita Bahuguna Joshi had earlier vowed to rectify. ?We will implement the Supreme Court?s order in the state. A cabinet note is being prepared, and the same will be sent for the cabinet?s approval,? she had said.The erstwhile Samajwadi Party government had deferred taking a decision on the matter in view of strong objections from Muslims. Community leaders maintained that as the nikahnama contains all the relevant details pertaining to marriages, the state should treat it as a valid substitute for the registration certificate. ",

Now, the project is being carried on in a planned, scientific and implementable manner and any obstruction in that behalf will not be tolerated,? the bench said.The tribunal reconstituted the principal committee, formed to see the execution of the cleaning of the Yamuna, and included Shashi Shekhar, former secretary of ministry of water resources, as a special invitee.It also convened a meeting of stakeholders, including officials from Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, on August 8 at 3pm at the tribunal to discuss the cleaning and rejuvenation of the Yamuna.During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the Delhi government told the NGT that steps were being taken by the Delhi Jal Board to ensure that work to clean the Yamuna was completed with utmost expeditiousness.?In relation to the project report of the second phase of the Yamuna cleaning, it is submitted that it has already been filed before the tribunal as well as sent to the principal committee, ministry of water resources,? the bench noted.The directions came when the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017 project.The tribunal had earlier banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of R5,000 for violation of the order.",

   "text": "Speaking ahead of his final appearance on the field at the upcoming world championships, eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt warned his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. On being asked about how he would feel in the 100m final at the upcoming world championships, Bolt said, \"Unbeatable and unstoppable\".",
   "ctext": "Usain Bolt has issued a stark warning to his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. The triple Olympic 100m and 200m champion insisted that the sport was on the mend following the staggering revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia but conceded more needed to be done to tackle the scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.?I don?t think it gets any worse than that,? he said, referring to the problems in Russia which he agreed had left the sport at rock bottom. ?But it?s on its way back up now. Hopefully, athletes will see what?s going on and understand that if they don?t stop what they?re doing the sport will die. And hopefully they will understand what the sport is going through and what they need to do as athletes to help it move forward.?But Bolt, who will hang up his spikes after the world championships in London which start on Friday, said he was still optimistic that these perennial problems could be tackled. ?You can?t be happy about doping at all, it?s not good for the sport,? he added. ?But over the years we?re doing a better job, it?s getting clean and we?re catching up to a lot of athletes. There?s an understanding that, listen, if you cheat you will get caught. Over time the sport will get better.?I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there?s nowhere else to go but up. The only way track and field has left to go is up.?Bolt has raced only three times this season, and last month appeared to be struggling with a back injury, but he insisted he was still the man to beat in the 100m, the qualifying rounds for which start on Friday. ?For some reason I am the underdog,? he said. ?That is what my team keep telling me so I have to prove myself once more. But I am confident in my abilities, always. When I go out there I am fully confident and ready to go ? 100%.?The last 100m race I ran was a 9.95sec which shows I am going in the right direction. It is all about who can keep their nerves. I have been here many times and I know I am ready. It is go time.?Bolt, who turns 31 later this month, also gave an emphatic answer when asked how he would feel on Saturday night after the 100m final. ?Unbeatable,? he said. ?Usain Bolt has retired unbeatable over that event. For me that will be the biggest headline. Unbeatable and unstoppable.?The Jamaican also insisted that he had been provided with extra motivation to win yet another world title following the tragic death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the Olympic silver medal winning high jumper, in a road accident in April.?It was a rough time,? he said. ?I have never had someone who passed away so close to me. I didn?t train for three weeks. My coach gave me my space, he gave me my time to get over it. But at some point the close net of people I was with said: ?Listen to us, Usain, I know it is hard but you need to get back training because Germaine would have wanted it ? he was looking forward to coming to your last race and seeing you compete and finishing off your legacy.??That really helped me get going again. It was hard. But now I really want to do it for him and his family ? and all the friends that supported me in the hard times.?",

But weeks later, she accused the police of forcing her to make statements, and said the godman never hurt her.In Kochi, the woman told police she stepped out of her house on Monday night when he allegedly jumped at her but fled after she attacked him. After her complaint, police alerted all city hospitals and found the man undergoing a surgery at a private hospital.The man had told hospital authorities that he injured his tongue in a bike accident and was arrested after the surgery was over and he was discharged. Doctors at the hospital said as he received serious injuries on the tongue, his speech will be slightly impaired.An earlier version of this story used a photo of a woman who has no connection with the case.

Police said they have arrested one of the accused, a juvenile, while the other is on the run. The incident, reported from a village in Sonepat?s Kharkhoda block, comes close on the heels of a series of similar incidents being reported from the state in the last two months. The police said the girl was taken to a hospital by her family on July 29 after she complained of stomach ache. The victim then narrated her ordeal to her mother. She said she was first raped by her cousins in December last year when they barged into her house when she was alone. The accused allegedly continued to rape her, threatening to kill her parents if she informed anyone.The girl, a school dropout, did not inform anyone out of fear. The police have registered a case under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the two. Kharkhoda station house officer (SHO) Pradeep Singh said the arrested boy was produced in court which sent him to juvenile home. Doctors at the Rohtak civil hospital have ruled out abortion at this stage, maintaining that it could be life-threatening to the minor girl. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in India allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.",

   "ctext": "If you drive a car in Delhi and its suburbs then bad and crowded roads are burning a big hole in your pocket.An ongoing study on how much fuel is wasted because of potholed roads and bad traffic has found that vehicles travelling on ?average?, crowded roads consumed nearly one-and-a-half time more fuel per kilometre compared to ?good?, fuel-efficient roads. The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre. Subsequent tests will be conducted with small cars and loaded and empty trucks. The findings use a three-tier grading system to assess road conditions. Traffic congestion is also a parameter.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) conducted the study. It was found that an SUV consumed about 40.25 millilitres of fuel per kilometre when it travelled on the Noida Expressway, considered a good, fuel-efficient road. The same vehicle consumed about 95.5 millilitres of fuel for every kilometre when travelling from Noida Expressway to Kalindi Kunj and onto Jasola.The consumption was even higher at 137.2 millilitres per km when the vehicle travelled from Botanical Garden to Kailash Hospital in Noida. ?The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions,? said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRI?s transport and planning division.?The result is they end up paying more.?A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day. Although the extra expense incurred by an individual driver might not ring alarm bells, the cumulative wastage would be an added burden on India?s oil imports bill.The initial study was carried out on more than 600 km of the best roads in Delhi and its suburbs such as the Yamuna Expressway, Delhi Gurgaon Expressway and NH24 to collect the baseline data ? the best fuel-efficient roads. ?Now we are driving the same vehicles on various roads of Delhi to find out how much extra fuel they consume,? Kumar said.  ?Some of the roads that we have selected are Peeragarhi to Najafgarh, Kalindi Kunj to Jaitpur Extension and Mayur Vihar Ext to Trilok Puri among others.? ",

   "ctext": "Scores of easyJet passengers were stranded on the Greek island of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) after their plane developed technical difficulties and a replacement aircraft was prevented from flying in because of mating turtles. Passengers expressed fury at easyJet?s lack of communication and ?incredibly bad? handling of the delay, which began on Sunday afternoon.  Some travellers, who did not book on to other flights, were only able to make it home on Tuesday.  A fault with a wing flap was announced by the captain soon after passengers boarded the flight to Gatwick at around 3pm on Sunday, and there was no communication for another hour.  Despite being told the problem would be resolved in 20 minutes, passengers were soon asked to disembark.  They were forced to wait through ?hours of nothingness,? according to Rebecca Morris, 39, who was travelling with her husband and two small children.  She described the facilities at Zakynthos airport as ?basic? and said there was no help or guidance from easyJet apart from the odd automated text message.  ?There was no food or refreshments and there was no representative from easyJet,? Morris said.  She said that while her family?s travel agents helped them find accommodation and taxis, other passengers were left to ?fend for themselves?.  A similar process was repeated on Monday.  The airline said the night curfew ? apparently in place because of vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby ? had prevented an alternative aircraft being sent out. The sea turtle breeding season is well under way in Zakynthos. According to Archelon, a group dedicated in protecting sea turtles in Greece, late June to early July see the highest levels of spawning. The group has recorded 500 nests on the island so far, but that is fewer than in previous years. EasyJet later apologised for the delay. A spokesman said: ?Unfortunately easyJet was unable to operate flight EZY8746 from Zante to London Gatwick on Sunday 30 July due to a technical fault with the aircraft and had to delay the flight overnight.  ?Engineers were immediately dispatched to Zante and believed that the technical issue was rectified yesterday, however it then reoccurred before boarding which meant the flight could not operate. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will only operate if it is safe to do so.  ?We do all possible to try and minimise delays and as such planned to send a replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport. The flight departed Zante and arrived at London Gatwick today.  ?Around a quarter of passengers travelled on flights with alternative carriers yesterday afternoon. Passengers have been provided with hotel accommodation and expenses in line with EU261 regulations and will also be entitled to EU261 compensation.?",

The police then used a ladder to get people out of the lift.The police have not registered any case in the matter with Dev stating that a case could be filed if a complained is received.Saturday?s incident was not a stray one as Gurgaon has witnessed a number of tragedies involving elevators in the last few years.On April 7, 2009, Nishant Sharma, an employee with marketing and consulting company Sapient, was killed after getting stuck under an elevator when he was trying to go to his office on the 10th floor of Cyber Greens building in DLF Phase 3. His body was crushed after the elevator suddenly moved and trapped his leg. He was rushed to a private hospital with cardiac and respiratory seizure where he died on April 11. Five years later, on the night of May 26, 2014, eighteen members of a family, including children, from Sushant Lok were trapped for more than an hour inside an elevator at a deluxe hotel on MG Road. The police had to break the glass of the elevator and rescue the family. The police later arrested two bouncers who did not help the victims and even dissuaded the police from breaking the elevator?s glass.On April 22 this year, an elevator at Central Park-2 on Sohna road fell to the lower basement with a family reportedly stuck inside.",

But the airline never took ownership of them, and the planes have been stored in the Mojave Desert, where the dry, hot climate slows corrosion, Defense One said.Trump rattled Boeing in December before taking office by saying in a Twitter message: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called Trump and told him the cost could be reduced if the Air Force changed its requirements, sources familiar with the conversation said at the time.White House officials in December were unclear where Trump obtained the $4 billion figure. The Air Force has estimated it would spend $2.87 billion through 2021 for development of a new presidential aircraft. The cost of refitting the commercial 747-8s with the enhanced electronics and security systems required for Air Force One were unclear.Boeing had said it expected to add the Air Force One jets to its backlog, which currently numbers 20 planes - five passenger models and 15 freighters.The redeployment to the Air Force of jets already built for another customer would effectively reduce Boeing?s future 747 production plans by two aircraft. But it would provide a home for two airframes that have been built but remain unsold.The Air Force operates two military versions of the Boeing 747-200B aircraft that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard.

The research studied global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth, and further stated that there is 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5�C.",
   "ctext": "There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to ?well below 2C? above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. ?We?re closer to the margin than we think,? said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. ?If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned.? Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UN?s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India ? two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The world?s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trump?s pledge to remove the US, the world?s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  ?Even if the 2C target isn?t met, action is very important,? said Raftery. ?The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. ?We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won?t avoid 2C, and so it?s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.? Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could ?dramatically? change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the research?s conclusions were ?reasonable? but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. ?I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,? he said. ?But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. ?If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it?s clear these things can change faster than people predict.? Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  ?It?s like you?re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,? he said. ?You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it?s going to be.?John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an ?urgent call to action?. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 ? findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact.Sterman said the US must ?dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast.?More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.?",

Maybe that?s why, the actor didn?t shy away when she put up on social media that she is looking for work.?I?m feeling very proud of myself [after my Instagram post]. I feel like I?m launching myself again?. at this age! So what? I am not dead. I am fit, I look good and I can still act, so why not! I?m not ashamed,? says national award-winning actor Neena Gupta in an exclusive chat with us.    I live in mubai and working am a good actor looking fr good parts to play A post shared by Neena Gupta (@neena_gupta) on Jul 27, 2017 at 10:11pm PDT The 62-year-old, on Friday, posted on Instagram (and Twitter), that ?she is a good actor looking for good parts to play.? And her daughter, Masaba Gupta (with cricketer Vivian Richards) reposted it along with a message. ?I thought she?ll scold me saying ?you don?t know anything about social media and you are posting this rubbish?. But when I read her post, I realised she understands,? says Neena, adding that she was moved to tears on reading Masaba?s post.Asked what triggered her to share this post, Neena says, ?Everybody thinks that after my marriage, I have moved to Delhi and I don?t work anymore. So, I get so putt off and then I see so many roles being offered to other actors of my age.?I live in mumbai and i am working and i am a good actress koee kam hai toe batao? Neena Gupta (@Neenagupta001) July 28, 2017Sharing a recent incident that left her ?frustrated and disappointed?, Neena adds, ?There was a very nice and lengthy role in a big film and I knew that director very well but he just took someone else, who was not even a Punjabi, and this was a Punjabi woman?s role. I called him and asked ?Punjabi ka role Maharashtrian ko de raha hai, meri umar ka? Tune mere ko kyun nahi liya??.And he said ?Sorry Neena, mujhe dhyaan hi nahi aaya. Mujhe laga tu toh ab Delhi mein rehti hai aur kaam nahi karti.? After that I decided that I still have enough time to start again? mujhe koi sharam nahi hai to ask for work.?The actor, who recently played the role of a mother in a film called The Music Teacher, feels lucky that people still remember for the TV show Saans, which was two decades ago. ?This profession is such that if you don?t work for some time, people forget you. It?s like being out of sight and out of mind,? says Neena confessing that it was a conscious decision after marriage to not work actively, as her husband was in a stable job. ?But I realized that he was working all the time and I was sitting at home waiting for him. So I thought this is not going to work and that?s why I said that no one should leave work for anything in the world.?    Just the other day I was telling someone .. how I am never afraid/ shy to ask for work. Its obviously genetic. My mother put up this post on her instagram today. I mean,my 62yr old national award winning mother. She told me I must always work .. no matter what .. it keeps you from getting old...she told me they don't write for women her age anymore ... I don't think anyone can replicate what she did for TV anymore.. she complains that she can't do PR .. but says 'I do good work,that's my PR'.. time and again we've spoken about how whatever she asks for ... in due time ,she gets... But that's the magic of a pure heart. The universe just can't refuse you... the only advice I have the guts to give her is.. don't work with anyone who won't respect you ,at this age , that's the bare minimum & it's a strange strange industry she's in... the advice she gives me in return is..'whatever you do,free ka PR mat khaana,your only someone's kid/wife/niece/sister for this long. Prove yourself. WORK. Walk the talk & fly ????? @neena_gupta #neenaji A post shared by Masabs ? (@masabagupta) on Jul 28, 2017 at 9:34am PDT My problem is that I can do variety of roles. So when filmmakers are casting, they don?t think of me because I am not slotted.Neena also feels that filmmakers mostly consider her a TV face and not a commercial mainstream film actor. ?If you do one big commercial film and it?s a hit, everybody takes you for that particular kind of a role. My problem is that I can do variety of roles. I can look Punjabi, South Indian, gareeb and ameer too. So when filmmakers are casting, they don?t think of me because I am not slotted. I thought I will do all kinds of roles on TV and people will come to me but aisa nahi hota,? asserts the actor.While most actors these days bank on PR promotions, Neena modestly admits that she just can?t do it ?Somehow, I am genetically not fit for that. I?m a very shy person and find it difficult to ask for work even if I know somebody for ages. I expect ki woh bulayenge, but it?s not a correct attitude in this profession and it gets mistaken for arrogance too. So, I am making an effort. Although my PR is bad but this is the best PR I have done for myself and I didn?t even have to pay anyone to promote me,? she quips.Follow @htshowbiz for more",

However, the judge said nobody would've thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.",
   "ctext": "Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a �15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blue?s allegation that during a ?night of heavy drinking? at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct?s Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him �15m if the company?s shares doubled to �8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was ?a lot more interesting than some?, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.?The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol,? the judge said in his ruling. ?But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings.?The evening at the Horse and Groom was, in any event, a considerably less formal occasion than the senior management meetings, as there was no agenda or structure for the occasion and the conversation was largely social or general chat, rather than being specifically directed to any business subject.? Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a ?comprehensive? victory.In a statement, the businessman said: ?The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded �8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.?Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been ?obviously just banter?.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and ?consumed a lot of alcohol?.?I can?t remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,? Ashley had said. ?I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. ?If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him �15m if he could increase [Sports Direct?s] share price to �8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn?t being serious.? He said he paid Blue, whom he called ?Jeffers?, �1m for ?other deals? unrelated to the night in the Horse & Groom.Sports Direct?s shares hit the �8 price target in February 2014. The shares have since collapsed below �3, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed workers at the retailer?s Derbyshire warehouse were being paid less than the minimum wage.Shortly after the shares hit �8 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue?s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: ?It?s hit 8!!!!!?.Blue told the judge that Ashley was a ?serious businessman?. He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was ?like nothing else I have ever seen?, but he said Ashley sometimes did business ?in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues?.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was ?effectively a pub lock-in? and said the businessman would take naps under tables at ?boring? meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of �1.5m, and Blue bills of ?�1m-odd?. The judge said Blue would have to pick up Ashley?s legal bills and �600,000 would have to be paid on account within the next month.Lawyers indicated that Blue had been ?assisted? by insurers in launching the litigation.

   "ctext": "New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) BSNLs one-third of prime land holdings alone is estimated to be now worth Rs 65,000 crore, way higher than the book value of Rs 975 crore for its entire land assets recorded decades ago, a senior company official said. Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) had a book value of Rs 975 crore for the 15,000-odd land and building assets it holds, Chairman and Managing Director Anupam Shrivastava said. This valuation was arrived at decades back, and in order to reflect a true picture the company got a reassessment done using the fair value method. BSNL -- figured among the top loss making firms with a net loss of about Rs 3,880 crore in the governments Public Enterprises Survey 2015-16 -- initiated the valuation exercise as part of project Vasundhara in April this year. KPMG was roped in as a consultant for the project, which is now nearing completion. The exercise, done alongside the aggressive business revival plans the company pursues, saw one-third of the freehold land assets, mostly in prime locations in major cities being reassessed at the current market value. \"We decided to go for fair valuation of a third of our land parcels...freehold land. For entire land holding, the book value was so far Rs 975 crore in our books of account. With this, the fair valuation has been estimated at about Rs 65,000 crore just for one-third of land parcels,\" he told PTI here. According to Shrivastava, the valuation was taken up as part of a \"special window allowed under the Indian Accounting Standard\". \"We were informed by our consultant KPMG that a window of opportunity was provided for this year, for all companies... So we are among companies that have undertaken this exercise of fair valuation of the land parcels,\" he said. The valuation exercise is \"97-98 per cent complete\", he added. The valuation includes land parcels in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Chennai and Kolkata, among others. \"The land on which BSNL has its corporate office has itself been valued at nearly Rs 2,500 crore,\" he added.

Capita has said participants were made fully aware that free training is provided to only those who successfully complete the course.",
   "ctext": "Capita, one of the UK?s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded payouts of up to �21,000 from graduates who tried to pull out of an unpaid training scheme under which they were not guaranteed a job.The company, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, has been criticised for advertising a number of roles in its IT resourcing division that stipulate applicants must be a graduate and able to attend between two and four months of unpaid training in London or Manchester.Former trainees who spoke to The Guardian said they had been disappointed with the scheme, as the training consisted almost exclusively of online reading from a digital library without any direct teaching or on-the-job experience.One former trainee described the course as ?absolutely useless?. They said: ?All you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed. I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay �21,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.?Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about �21,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about �1,200.?I think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,? the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to ?fill HR gaps? rather than being given roles suitable to her training.Capita said that it now charged �13,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.A spokesperson said: ?All participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.?Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita?s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The group?s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to �20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: ?The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of �20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.??We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.?Individuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.?",

It was a ten minute narration, and the story focused on the vulnerabilities of the two characters Sultan and Shoaib. He didn?t even have a full script, but I was sold on the narration.

   "text": "USA's Caeleb Dressel won three gold medals within 90 minutes at the World Aquatics Championships on Saturday, to become the world's first swimmer to ace three events on a single night at a world meet. Dressel's medal haul comprised individual golds in 50-metre freestyle and 100-metre butterfly, besides a world record-breaking performance in the 4x100-metre mixed freestyle relay.",
   "ctext": "Caeleb Dressel knows the comparisons are coming.After pulling off an unprecedented Triple Crown at swimming?s world championships, it?s time to take on the legacy of Michael Phelps.The 20-year-old Dressel established himself as America?s newest star of the pool Saturday, becoming the first swimmer to win three gold medals on a single night at either the worlds or the Olympics.Not even Phelps managed such an audacious feat.Dressel won the 50m freestyle and the 100m butterfly before leading off a world-record performance in the 4x100-meter mixed freestyle relay.?The comparisons are probably inevitable,? Dressel said. ?But I?m not the same person as Michael.?Yet it was downright Phelps-like the way he pulled off a remarkable night of swimming at Duna Arena. Dressel raced three times over the course of about two hours ? and won every time. Not to mention, he had to find time to warm down and get to three medal ceremonies.?I think I only had to run twice,? Dressel said with a smile.The University of Florida student ? yep, he?s got an algebra exam coming up Monday that he?ll be taking online ? has won six golds medals in Budapest.That gives him a shot at moving into more rarified territory: Phelps is the only swimmer to win seven golds at a world championships, which he did at Melbourne in 2007 as a prelude to his record eight golds the following year at the Beijing Olympics.Dressel will be a virtual lock to win his seventh when he competes on the 4x100 medley relay Sunday, the final event of the championships.Again, those comparisons to Phelps.?It?s a tough question,? Dressel said. ?I don?t know if I welcome them. But I know they?re going to come. I don?t think it puts any pressure on me. I just want to keep doing my thing at this meet and for the future.?Phelps was certainly impressed and texted his congratulations shortly after the relay event. ?This kid is on fire!!? Phelps wrote on Instagram, including a picture of him celebrating with Dressel during a gold medal-winning relay they were both on last summer at the Rio Olympics. ?So damn fun to watch buddy!!!!?Dressel started the night with a furious dash from one end of the pool to the other, adding the 50 free world title to the 100 free he already had. He came back about a half-hour later to nearly break Phelps? world record in the 100 fly, posting a time of 49.86 that was just four-hundredths off the mark set in 2009 at the rubber suit-aided championships in Rome.The final relay was merely a coronation, the Americans romping to gold in 3 minutes, 19.60 seconds ? eclipsing by nearly 3 1/2 seconds the mark they set two years ago at worlds.?Man, that was a lot of fun,? Dressel said.He even managed to overshadow Katie Ledecky, who won her fifth gold medal of the meet by cruising to victory in the 800 free. Yet Budapest will be remembered as bit of a disappointment for the star of the 2016 Summer Games, who settled for silver in the 200 free and didn?t come close to breaking any of her personal bests.Ledecky won in 8:12.68, which was nearly eight seconds off her world record at Rio de Janeiro.?I?ve never walked away from a season completely satisfied, even last year,? she said. ?I can really take what I?ve learned and use it moving forward. It gets me really excited. If that was my bad year for the next four years, then the next couple years are going to be pretty exciting.?Sweden?s Sarah Sjostrom was another standout, bouncing back from a disappointing loss the previous night to win gold in the 50 fly and set a world record in the semifinals of 50 free. Her time of 23.67 broke the mark of 23.73, set in 2009 by Britta Steffen.In the women?s 200 backstroke, Emily Seebohm of Australia shrugged off the roaring Hungarian crowd to take gold over home-country favorite Katinka Hosszu.Sjostrom set her second world record of the meet, having already established a new standard in the 100 free while swimming the leadoff leg of the 4x100 free relay.But even the Swedish star took note of Dressel?s performance.?I don?t even know if he went to the Olympics last year,? she said. ?He took a really big step this year as we can see. It?s really impressive, really cool to see.?Indeed, Dressel has emerged as the breakout performer of these championships, with a bit of help from the relatively new mixed relays. Two of his golds came in events that feature men and women on the same team, races Phelps never competed in at worlds.?It?s crazy,? Dressel said. ?But I had mixed relays helping me out, so it?s a bit different.?Yet no less impressive.Dressel led off the mixed free relay with a blistering time of 47.22 for the first 100 ? even more remarkable given what he?d already been through ? and his three teammates ? Nathan Adrian, Mallory Comerford and Simone Manuel ? took it from there.?That last relay was a lot of fun,? Dressel said. ?I wanted to lead it off even though it meant less to get ready for it. It was such a blast.?The whole night was.?I haven?t had much time to think,? Dressel said, pondering the significance of it all. ?As physically demanding as it is, mentally it?s even more straining. So I have 24 hours until my next swim. I?ll give myself 30 minutes tonight to, I guess, let it sink in a bit, then it?s time to refocus for that relay tomorrow.?",

While ten major cases were reported from Mumbai Metropolitan Region, most cases were reported in other areas such as Thane and Dombivli. Bombay High Court had banned construction on wetlands after the NGO filed a PIL to protect them. ",
   "ctext": "A court order protecting them and several reports pointing out their importance notwithstanding, wetlands across the state continue to be destroyed. Between 2012 and 2017 alone, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported, a report compiled by the Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti revealed at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa, on Thursday. Ten major cases were reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, but the most cases were reported in Thane, at Kalher, Kasheli and Dombivli among other areas. In Mumbai, the destruction is taking place right under our noses ? a 400-acre patch opposite Millat Nagar in Oshiwara-Lonkhandwala, a 15-acre patch at Shivaji Nagar, a 200 acre patch in Charkop and a 10-acre patch in Dahisar.Why does this matter to you? Wetlands are areas of land covered by water, and apart from being home to several species of plants and animals, they act as a carbon sink by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and cleaning the air you breathe.READ: Maharashtra government order to save wetlands: List those larger than 2.25ha by September?More than 500 wetland destruction cases were reported in five years. This couldn?t have been possible if not for active support from government machinery such as police and revenue department,? said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti. ?The state mangrove cell, meanwhile, has managed to keep the wetlands under their control, relatively safe.?In 2014, the Bombay HC banned reclamation and construction on wetlands after Vanashakti filed a PIL to protect them. Stalin said even during the wetland grievance redressal committee meetings (formed by the state as per HC directions), corporations and revenue departments refused to restore degraded wetlands citing poor funds and lack of places to dump debris from wetlands. ?Despite several court orders, municipal corporations in Mumbai, Thane, Mira Bhayander and Vasai are ignorant about conserving wetlands,? Stalin said. According to the national wetland atlas developed by the Union environment ministry, Maharashtra (spread across 3.07 lakh sqkm) has a wetland cover of just 10,145 sqkm . The Vanashakti data comes a week after HT reported the state had directed every district to document wetlands larger than 2.25 hectares by September, to protect them. Before this directive, the state mapped 320 wetlands in forest areas across 25 districts . Beefing up security and tightening laws were the only ways to protect wetlands, experts said. ?Wetland destruction is a much larger violation than just destroying mangroves, which are a part of wetlands. The state needs to levy stricter fines and soon,? said Arvind Untawale, executive secretary of the Mangrove Society of India. ?The Vanashakti report is an eye-opener to the massive loss already incurred by the state.?Konkan commissioner Jagdish Patil told HT, ?We are drafting an action plan to protect these sites better. Once collectors submit their wetland lists, the panel will decide a strong action plan.?",

   "text": "A new study has found the rule that patients must complete the course of their prescribed antibiotics is false instead they should stop taking the drugs when they feel better. The study disproves traditional practice of completing courses, which claims that taking too few tablets allows the disease-causing bacteria to mutate and become resistant to the drug.",
   "ctext": "Telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned.Patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug.But Martin Llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case. In an analysis in the British Medical Journal, the experts say ?the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance?.There are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough. The most obvious example is tuberculosis, they say. But most of the bacteria that cause people to become ill are found on everybody?s hands in the community, causing no harm, such as E coli and Staphylococcus aureus. People fall ill only when the bug gets into the bloodstream or the gut. The longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop.The experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past.In hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs. ?Outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better,? they say. That, they add, is in direct contravention of World Health Organisation advice.Other experts in infectious diseases backed the group. ?I have always thought it to be illogical to say that stopping antibiotic treatment early promotes the emergence of drug-resistant organisms,? said Peter Openshaw, president of the British Society for Immunology. ?This brief but authoritative review supports the idea that antibiotics may be used more sparingly, pointing out that the evidence for a long duration of therapy is, at best, tenuous. Far from being irresponsible, shortening the duration of a course of antibiotics might make antibiotic resistance less likely.?Alison Holmes, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said a great British authority, Prof Harold Lambert, had made the same point in a Lancet article entitled ?Don?t keep taking the tablets? as early as 1999. ?It remains astonishing that apart from some specific infections and conditions, we still do not know more about the optimum duration of courses or indeed doses in many conditions, yet this dogma has been pervasive and persistent.?Jodi Lindsay, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at St George?s, University of London, said it was sensible advice. ?The evidence for ?completing the course? is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,? she said. ?The evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better ? for example, TB.?But the Royal College of GPs expressed concerns. ?Recommended courses of antibiotics are not random,? said its chair, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. ?They are tailored to individual conditions and in many cases, courses are quite short ? for urinary tract infections, for example, three days is often enough to cure the infection. ?We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication midway through a course once they ?feel better?, because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. It?s important that patients have clear messages and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known. Changing this will simply confuse people.?England?s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said: ?The message to the public remains the same: people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. To update policies, we need further research to inform them.?[The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] is currently developing guidance for managing common infections, which will look at all available evidence on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.?The Department of Health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug-resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue.?",

The Telangana Prohibition and Excise Department had seized 700 dots of LSD worth Rs 20 lakh and 35gm of MDMA -- commonly known as Ecstasy -- worth Rs 1.4 lakh from three peddlers. The month-long investigation brought to light the drug trade in Hyderabad, which involves not only Tollywood stars and MNC professionals, but also school students from reputed institutions.Commenting on the drug bust scenario, Rana said, ?Honestly, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion. If a filmmaker or an actor takes drugs, it really doesn?t bother me. They are adults and it?s their lives and they can do whatever they want. I don?t give a damn if you take drugs.?What worries Rana is that children are taking drugs. ?The dangerous story about school kids doing drugs worries me. That?s something that needs to be taken more seriously and addressed immediately. When youngsters who don?t have a mind of their own are doing drugs, it scares me,? he said.?Who is supplying drugs to these kids? Are these people immigrants? How are they bringing drugs into the country,? Rana asked.On the career front, Rana awaits the release of Telugu-Tamil political drama Nene Raju, Nene Mantri.",

But I don't care.\" Tiger's sister Krishna Shroff is three years younger to him.",
   "ctext": "Usually soft-spoken, actor Tiger Shroff says that he is ?over-protective? beyond imagination when it comes to his sister Krishna Shroff. ?If you ask me, obviously I?m the kind of guy who just wants to wrap his sister in a blanket, because I am an over-protective brother,? says Tiger. ?I know that after saying this, people will react and say, ?Oh, he?s a sexist,? and I?ll be called all sorts of names. But I don?t care, because people like to perceive things in their own way.? Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars ?padding?, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasn?t referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didn?t fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her ?topless? photos on Instagram ? the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back ? even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter.    #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp. ???

A lot of people out there get [all sorts of] photo shoots done and post their pictures, so it?s her wish, whether she wanted to or not.

With @kishushroff ? #natural #photography #portraitseries A post shared by Krishna Shroff (@kishushroff) on Aug 20, 2015 at 6:22am PDT Stating that his father rarely gives him feedback on his performance, Tiger adds, ?The maximum inputs come from Krishna. She has studied filmmaking, so she?s very intellectual in that sense. The best piece of advice she gave me was, ?Don?t overdo it, and just be in the character. Don?t do too much, don?t do too little.? Thankfully, after Munna Michael, she didn?t have much to say, because she was there on the sets all the time.? That?s because Krishna was assisting on the film.?She was like my second director,? says Tiger. ?Every time I was unsure about a particular scene, she?d always be there to support and guide me, because she could see how it looked on the monitor screen. She?d tell me things like how Nawazji [Nawazuddin Siddiqui] was reacting, what was happening in the background, what I shouldn?t do in empty spaces, and how I could improvise.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",

Even when her sister, actor Shilpa Shetty, 42, is already a mother to a five-year-old son, Shamita says that she is taking it easy waiting for the ?right man? to come in her life.Ask her if she ever gets pressured by her mother, Shamita says, ?I won?t call it pressure. Every parent wants to see their child settle down. And initially, after I lost my dad, mom would be worried and all the focus comes on the other child, naturally. But I don?t really stress about it that much.?What does Shilpa have to say about this? Shamita quips, ?She is not concerned anymore now. She?s kind of understood that I need to find my own way, so she doesn?t pester me. [Also] When these things have to happen, they just happen.

It?s not about that for me. I want a companion whom I am going to be happy with. And I don?t mind if the person comes in my life at a later stage, even when I am 40 or 50. I?m not going to sit and stress over it or plan things out,? says Shamita adding that she won?t prefer an actor as her life partner.So who?s the ideal guy for Shamita that she would want to spend her life with?  ?He has to be someone who can make me laugh and has a drive and passion for whatever he does in his life. I can?t handle dishonesty; I like integrity in people and for me, that?s very important in a man,? says Shamita, adding that anyone who matches these criteria, she would want to know him better.Follow @htshowbiz for more",
